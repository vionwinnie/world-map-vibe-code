I only had a few hours in Skopje but I already felt a different vibe from that in Serbia and Kosovo. It became more like the old district in Ottoman village in the old bazaar part but with interesting sculptures all around the central part of the city. Really hope to be back during the summer to visit Ohrid - the lake and the awesome church right next to it
