As part of the backpacking trip before starting my masters, I met up with Vera and traveled in Switzerland together! This is the last stop before I went back to  Hong Kong. We went to Jungfrau and Grindelwald, it's very breathtaking nature scenery! Ice were still melting on the trail. The only comparable mountain I found that rivals the idyllic fairytale feel of Switzerland is Mount Rainier on the Skyline loop with wildflowers fielding the floor. We took cable car up to hike the 5 lakes trail. Things were pricey so we bought ingredients from the grocery and made pasta at home! Would love to see Switzerland in winter in the future
