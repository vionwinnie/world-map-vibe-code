A decade throwback to the last exploration in the Middle East with the fun-loving Al-Nadee al-iktishaaf! Thanks Esra for bringing me back :) Even though no longer in Jordan, the same feeling of hospitality and warmth, mixed with the dusty air, traffic jam, spotty phone signal, transcended across countries and across time. All the moments are precious reminders of however little we have materially or how bad the tumultuous times that we situate in, we can share the happiness around us. Congratulations Esra, to one of the most beautiful, bravest, generous souls that I have ever known ❤️❤️ elf mabroook ~~
