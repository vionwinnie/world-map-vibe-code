So I took a bus to go to Prishtina from Beograd. Babies,  coughing,  crowd,  border controls, old woman talking on the phone for two hours non-stop, finally I arrived at Prishtina. Blerta met up with me at the hostel and we walked briefly downtown and chatted at Dat e Nat! I felt so glad that there are other girls out there learning how to code and dedicate their bits of creativity to rebuild the economy. At the same time,  I did not like those expats who stayed at the hostel. Either they were NGO workers or people who were just hanging around and went to bars to meet young 17 year old girl. Getting high, drunk, and be a hedonist seems to be their motto of the day. My less than 24 hrs stay did not suffice for me to understand a lot about Kosovo definitely it made think more about this part of the world and how it fit into the discussion of the EU and American dominance (when theres a boulevard called Bill Clinton, it really makes you think)
