went with daddy to Melbourne for a week. Met up with my LPC English teacher for lunch and he treated us to a field trip to see Philips Island for the penguin. We also did another day tour to see the vineyards and dad was so happy to try all the different kinds of wine and can name them correctly. Would have loved to try more food but back then, there were no google maps and hard to identify foodie restauratns on the spot. So I was upset at my dad for bringing us to the mall for food. Sorry dad >< but i also booked youth hostel for us and it was a little awkward for my dad to stay at places like that. I am still very impressed how my dad chaperoned a teenage girl to go on a trip together. Miss you daddy.
