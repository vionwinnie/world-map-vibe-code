Arrived in Seville for the Spring Feria festival. Explored Ronda (Camino Del Rey hike at 1pm), Frigiliana (White Village by the sea), and Granada (visited Alhambra Palace). Drove between cities, with scenic stops in white villages and the mountains. Hiked Mulhacen, the highest mountain in the Iberian Peninsula. Enjoyed local culture, cathedrals, and historic sites in Seville and Granada. Used a mix of flights, car rentals, and walking for transportation.
